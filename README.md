Braccio Robot Controller
=========================

### Made as a part of a project for ABB's Science Club 2019.

Written in python, fetches movement instructions from main controlling API, interprets them and then forwards to Arduino board through USB connection. Allows to grab, move and drop objects based on their coordinates relative to the robot. It can also move the robot's arm however needed.
